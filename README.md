# Inventory App

Inventory App built with Node.JS/Express as backend, MongoDB as database, and using Heroku to host it.

Using populateDB.js script will fill database with few categories and items which are considered as permanent. Updating and deleting those will be possible only by entering an admin password. Creating for users is not restricted by password, same goes for updating and deleting users category, item and item picture.

###### This project is mostly finished.
